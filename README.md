# Bootstrap 5 + Webpack 4

Get started with Bootstrap v5, the worldâ€™s most popular framework for building responsive, mobile-first sites, with Webpack.JS (v4+) and a template starter page.

I also add customization with SASS to you compile your own version of Bootstrap. To use this repo you need [Node.JS](https://nodejs.org/) installed in your computer.

This project is an evolving version of the [nrcfrls](https://github.com/nrcfrld/bootstrap5-webpack) repo.
